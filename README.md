re doing the project to strenthen my skills

1. checkRequire for each input

- first i create a function to check each input separately but i had to repeat the code multiple time ex: check username, check email... so i add a loop to loop through the element and put them in an array.
  now to checking the length

2. however, i might have to repeat the DOM manipulation for each time user doesn't meet requirement => create function to display error and success

3. now checking the length of inputs, i create a function that will check if input has at least min characters, and not exceed max characters. if they qualify, use displaySuccess function

4.
